        Dear Colleagues,</p>

        We prepare for you initial version of astronomical fandom, a place where all amateur astronomers can start doing real science
        and share their experience with others. <br><br>

        ARQONIA is a concept application created by amateur astronomers for other amateur astronomers and its main purpose is to
        integrate astronomical society even more. <br><br>

        First test release is about to occur in next couple of months and it will consists of several fancy functionalities which will
        help you start doing real science. In the first release we concentrate on doing photometry of stars, comets and planetoids from images
        data reduction, through aperture photometry until plotting typical astronomical diagrams like light curves.<br><br>

        We hope you will enjoy it. Don't forget to subscribe and let as know about your needs and expectations for the next releases.
    </p>
